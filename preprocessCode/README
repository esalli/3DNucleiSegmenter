Run the pre-processing scripts in following order (note, you need to have downloaded the data separately)
 
For the 12 spheroids:

python expandImages.py 		# Makes data more isotropic by adding slices between existing slices. For spheroids, bilinear interpolation is used. For ground truth, a contour interpolation method is used (not needed if using downloaded data)
python nucleiMarkersIso.py  # Creates markers for training (not needed if using downloaded data)

For the independent datasets:

python preprocessIndependentDatasets.py


If you want to create filtered datasets to evaluate the conventional baseline methods run:
python bilateralFiltering.py
python gradientAnisotropicDiffusionFiltering.py
npython onlocalmeansFiltering.py
